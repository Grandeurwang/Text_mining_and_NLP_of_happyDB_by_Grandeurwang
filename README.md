### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only ***individual*** (as opposed to *team*) this semester. This project is finished by **Guanren Wang**

### Background
HappyDB is a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments. The goal of the corpus is to advance the state of the art of understanding the causes of happiness that can be gleaned from text.

You may find HappyDB here: [Link](https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/)

+ Explored and visualized the relationships between key words in order to uncover causes of happiness
+ Identified the latent cause for the discrepancy between Americans’ happiness and Indians’ happiness using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
